# DiscordConsole supports 'placeholders'
# That means that you can use the PlaceholderAPI plugin to add placeholders to the messages,
# for example to show the current online players on the server in a command

# DiscordConsole also has its own placeholders, which can be used in different places
# Here is a brief overview
# {player_count} The amount of online players
# {player_max} The maximum of players allowed to join
# {total_players} The amount of players to have ever joined your server
# {motd} The server's motd
# {name} The server's name
# {version} The server's version
# We also have discord channel-only placeholders
#   {channel_name} The name of the current discord channel
#   {channel_topic} The topic of the current discord channel
#   {channel_id} The id of the current discord channel
# We also have discord server only placeholders
#   {guild_name} The discord guild's name
#   {guild_id} The discord guild's id
#   {guild_members} The approximate member count of the guild
#   {guild_description} The guild's description
# We also have discord member only placeholders
#   {member_nickname} A discord user's nickname
#   {member_username} A discord member's username
#   {member_id} A discord member's id



# Whether to send debug messages (useful for the developer to find more information about issues)
